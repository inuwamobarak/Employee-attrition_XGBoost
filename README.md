ABOUT THE PROJECT

Employee-attrition Prediction

Employee attrition prediction using machine learning models

This project utilizes a public dataset available online in Kagle dataset repository to experiment machine learning processes. In practice, the XGBoost algorithm is selected for model building due to its ability in handling imbalanced data. We do not need to always balance data before using when we have the flexibility of utilizing powerful models. In a case where we are tied to a particular model that can not handle imbalanced data well, then we can use techniques like resampling.

Employee Attrition can be a problem easily when it is not controlled. From experienced staffs leaving the company, to spending and recruting new staffs at different cost rate like like time, money and learning curves. Thanks to IBM scientist for making this experimental set available. Any comapny could recreat a personalized dataset and utilize this model. 

The Dataset
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
